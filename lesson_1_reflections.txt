How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It showed exactly the differences between the two documents and all I had to do was file through them.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I'd be able to try new things without worry that I'll break something or that I missed something with my mass revision.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
Pros: you can save whenever, the commits are more meaningful
Cons: you have to remember to save, and I often forget >.<

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
So that multipart programs can be saved too

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Use git log to find the different and use git diff to see the changes between the two.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
because I can always go back to older versions if I have any errors

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
I don't know how to use/make commits yet :(
